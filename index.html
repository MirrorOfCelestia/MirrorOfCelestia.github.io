    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! You can call me <strong>Akira</strong> (also known as <em>MirrorOfCelestia</em>). I know most of you might skip this part, so don’t worry — there’s no vital info here. That said, I just want to thank you for taking the time to check out this guide (and hopefully enjoy the game too)!</p>
    <p><strong>Pokémon Academy Life Forever</strong> has been one of my favorite dating sims — fun, charming, and full of heart. But I’ll be honest: it has a steep learning curve. It took me multiple playthroughs to really understand how things worked, and I often found myself searching online for help… only to come up empty.</p>
    <p>That’s where this guide comes in. Whether you’re new or returning, this is meant to teach you everything you need to know to get the most enjoyable experience possible — before and during your playthroughs.</p>
    <p>I’ve done my best to make this guide clear, helpful, and easy to follow, so you can focus on what matters: enjoying your time at the Academy.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions, feedback (hopefully positive!), or constructive criticism, feel free to reach out. I’d love to hear from you and make this guide even better.</p>
    <p><strong>Good luck, and have fun!</strong></p>
    <p>— Akira Kagami (MirrorOfCelestia)</p>

  <h2>About Pokémon Academy Life Forever (PALF)</h2>
  <p>Pokémon Academy Life Forever (PALF) is a non-profit, fan-made Ren’Py visual novel developed by Freudian Creations. It takes place in an alternate Pokémon world where characters from the core Pokémon series are placed in a university setting to learn about the world of Pokémon.</p>
  <p>PALF is a remake of the original Pokémon Academy Life, a project that led to developer burnout and was eventually scrapped. The team at Freudian Creations took up the project and rebuilt it into what it is today.</p>
